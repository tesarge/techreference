          <p>This document serves primarily as a guide and reference for the PC game Age of Empires II. Age of Empires II is a real time strategy (RTS) game set during the Middle Ages and features civilizations from Europe, Asia, The Americas, and Africa. Each civilization has unique units and technologies that have various advantages and disadvantages. The player guides one of these civilizations through four "ages," The Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age, and Imperial Age. Each age opens the civilizations to better, stronger units and researchable technologies that improve efficiency. The game has two main forms of play: Single player scenarios and multiplayer. It also features a map and scenario creator. This guide focuses on gameplay.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Economy">
        <header>Basic Economy</header>
          <p>Setting up the economy is the first step at the beginning of a match. The player will begin with a Town Center and three villagers (the Chinese and Mayans start with five and four villagers, respectively). Villagers are the basic economic unit and are used to construct buildings and collect resources. Villagers can collect <code>gold</code> (g), <code>stone</code> (s), <code>food</code> (f), and <code>wood</code> (w). Each of these reources are used to construct buildings, create units, and research technologies. </p>
          <p>At the beginning of the game it is important to begin forming a stable economy to support the player later in the game. As the game goes on, more emphasis will be put on the creation of military units for attack and defense and less on reource collecting. Although one should continue to make villagers throughout the game, it is suggested to build as many as possible at the beginning for resource collection.</p>
  <p>All units require housing, so it is recommended to build a few <code>houses</code> in order to produce more villagers. Once a good number of houses have been built, focus some villagers on food and wood collection. These are the two most used resources in the Dark and Feudal Ages. Villagers can build <code>Lumber Camps</code> (w) and <code>Mills</code> (f) close to resources to speed the collection process. Villagers will be automated to keep collecting the same resource until the resource in range is depleted or until told to do otherwise. It is not recommended to collect stone until the Feudal Age.</p>
          <p>It is also advisible to not research technology until the Feudal age. Researching the technologies in the Dark Ages will delay your advancement to the next age. </p>
        </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Military">
        <header>Basic Military</header>
          <p>Players start with one light recon unit at the beginning of the game. This unit can be used for basic defense but more importantly for scouting the area. By holding down the Shift key and right-clicking the cursor around the map, the player can set the unit to explore the points selected. It is important to occasionaly recon enemy areas to see their advancement, but once the game has progressed and they have started created more military units, it is likey your unit will be killed.</p>
        <p>The first military building available is the <code>Barracks</code>, which creates infantry units. The barracks can make sword units and pole units. Swords units have a bonus against buildings and pole units have a bonus against cavalry units.</p>
        <p>In the Feudal age, players can build <code>Archery Ranges</code> and <code>Stables</code>. Archery units can make archers, spearman, and cavalry archers. Spearman have bonuses against archery units.</p>
        <p>In the Castle Age, players can build <code>Castles</code>. <code>Castles</code> are strong buildings that shoot arrows at enemy units and can also create unique units. Every civilization has unique Castle units. A list is provided below.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Scenarios">
        <header>Scenarios</header>
          <p>Most Civilizations have a unique scenario. Scnearios are single-player campaigns that usually follow a story or legend from the respective civilization. The Franks for instance have a scenario where the player follows a storyline as Joan of Arc.</p>
        </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Multiplayer">
        <header>Multiplayer</header>
          <p>Multiplayer games can be set up through LANs. However, with the introduction of Age of Empires onto the Steam platform, players can play games through Steam servers. Simply go to the multiplayer section from the home screen, select create multiplayer game, establish your game parameters, and invite other players. Players can also set player slots to be palyed by a computer player.</p>
